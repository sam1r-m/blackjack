### 1. Project Setups
- **Environment Setup:** Ensure development environment is ready. 
- **Project Structure:** Create a project directory with subdirectories for source code, tests, and any documentation.

### 2. Basic Game Implementation
- **Card and Deck Implementation:** Create classes for Cards and the Deck. Ensure the deck can be shuffled and cards can be dealt.
- **Player and Dealer Logic:** Implement classes for the Player and the Dealer, including the ability to hold hands of cards, make 
    decisions, and calculate hand values.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:** Develop the logic for a basic game of Blackjack, allowing a player to hit, stand, double down, or split. 
    Implement the dealer's logic according to standard rules.

### 3. Basic Strategy Integration
- **Strategy Table:** Encode the basic strategy into a form your program can use to make decisions (e.g., a lookup table or a set 
    of if-else statements).
- **Decision Making:** Adjust the player's decisions during gameplay based on the basic strategy, ensuring that the player follows 
    the optimal path given their hand and the dealer's upcard.

### 4. Card Counting Implementation
- **Count System:** Implement the Hi-Lo card counting system, updating the count with each card that is dealt.
- **Bet Adjustment:** Use the card count to adjust bets before the start of each hand, increasing bets when the count is high.
- **Strategy Adjustment:** Optionally adjust playing decisions based on the count, if certain adjustments are warranted beyond the 
    basic strategy.

### 5. Simulation and Testing
- **Simulator:** Create a simulation environment that allows you to play multiple hands automatically, tracking wins, losses, and 
    overall profitability.
- **Testing:** Write tests for the code to ensure accuracy in the game logic, strategy adherence, and card counting system. Automated 
    tests can help quickly identify any regressions or errors introduced during development.

### 6. Refinement and Advanced Features (Extra Unnecessary Stuff)
- **Performance Analysis:** Analyze the performance of the strategy over many games. Look for patterns or scenarios where the 
    strategy may not perform as expected and refine accordingly.
- **User Interface:** If desired, develop a user interface (UI) for the game, ranging from a simple command-line interface to a more 
    sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Additional Features:** Consider adding features like support for multiple players, variations of Blackjack rules, or different 
    card counting systems.

### 7. Documentation and Sharing
- **Code Documentation:** Document the code with comments and a README file explaining how to run the simulation, the structure of 
    the project, and any dependencies.
- **Results Sharing:** Share the results of your simulations, insights from implementing the basic strategy and card counting, and 
    any interesting findings from your project.
